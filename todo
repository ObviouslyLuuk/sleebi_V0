FIXES:
iPad:
    trouble with sliders? on iOS too
    also weirdly, the message for blue filter does show, but for link copied doesn't

ADDITIONS:
add email list signup

add channel screen

replace tipjar link with ko-fi widget and in-page panel

triggers as tags (triggertree)

filter based on triggers
filter based on duration
sort search results by date, views, like-ratio, etc
    
have watch page be an overlay on non-watch pages, on mobile, so the user can swipe the viewer into the bottom to keep browsing

optional calming music to play in background of videos, or noise?

video chapters

also show other ASMR Youtube videos, but embedded, with preroll ads, but stopping before postrolls
    little badge in the tile corner
    show overlay to explain when the user clicks on it
        This video is served by YouTube, therefore Sleebi has no control over the ads.
        Any ad revenue generated by this video goes to the creator of this video, and YouTube, not to Sleebi.
        Whether midroll ads are shown is up to the creator of this video. 
        However, disabling postroll ads is no longer possible on YouTube, therefore Sleebi will stop the video before the postroll ad.

        tl;dr: you won't be woken up by a postroll ad, any revenue from other ads go to the creator and YouTube.

have video preview GIFs when hovering over a video. Scrape from YT in the mouseover-overlay:

Apparently these expire as well..

add previews to the video player scrubber (where to host these? potentially one big sprite to save on requests)

add share on:

    email: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2102433/send-email-via-gmail

download button (doesn't work with YT download link but does work with local file)

only play automatically when the user has wifi: https://coyotess.medium.com/how-to-get-information-about-user-network-connection-in-javascript-4d63fd58f15f


AESTHETIC:
clean up controls on mobile (maybe with a settings button toggle)
    move timeline to the bottom of video and enable scrubbing at all times
    thinner version of fullscreen button
    keep brightness slider in view? it's nice
    somehow "comments will be added later" is split into two lines on mobile
    maaaaybe don't have as much controls delay in the middle as on the sides (like on YouTube)

remove bootstrap and replace with custom css

put svgs from player into sprite.svg

add a "more" button to the description

make brightness and volume sliders go up instead of sideways
