ISSUES:
    scrubbing on firefox not working? (comment on post #1)
    background play not working for iOS? (many comments on post #1, but not sure if they were checking the widget)

BUGS:
    can't scroll down when only video is on screen (on mobile, landscape)
    minifying JS makes spaces after commas disappear in strings that are displayed in the UI
        ideally text that will appear in UI should NOT be in JS files, but in a separate file, so that it doesn't suffer from minification
iPad:
    also weirdly, the message for blue filter does show, but for link copied doesn't

ADDITIONS:
sort search results by date, views, like-ratio, etc
add feedback form

on desktop fullscreen make controls time out after a while because you can't remove the cursor
add up and down arrow keys to change volume
can I somehow prevent right and left arrow keys from changing volume? This happens when the user is focused on the volume slider, but I don't want that to happen
pause when hitting spacebar

add small v button at top of player to engage miniplayer

add email list signup (form) with the footer

add channel screen

triggers as tags (triggertree)

filter based on triggers
filter based on duration

optional calming music to play in background of videos, or noise?

video chapters

make stats div clickable so you can scroll through channels and videos

also show other ASMR Youtube videos, but embedded, with preroll ads, but stopping before postrolls
    little badge in the tile corner
    show overlay to explain when the user clicks on it
        This video is served by YouTube, therefore Sleebi has no control over the ads.
        Any ad revenue generated by this video goes to the creator of this video, and YouTube, not to Sleebi.
        Whether midroll ads are shown is up to the creator of this video. 
        However, disabling postroll ads is no longer possible on YouTube, therefore Sleebi will stop the video before the postroll ad.

        tl;dr: you won't be woken up by a postroll ad, any revenue from other ads go to the creator and YouTube.
ads won't show unless the embed player is 
    click-to-play (we could probably hack this), 
    at least 200x200, 
    and on a safe website

    what about mute?
    what about display: none?
    what about autoplay?
    what about being blocked by a different element?
    what about being outside of the viewport?
    test this with a randomizing script for these factors that autofills a google form where the user can say whether they saw an ad or not
    or if we just want to test for watchtime, we could have a different video for every config and see which one(s) get any watchtime
        just have this be unlisted videos on my personal channel, but first probably test if all these are satisfied on a normal YT embed

have video preview GIFs when hovering over a video. Scrape from YT in the mouseover-overlay:

Apparently these expire as well..

add previews to the video player scrubber (where to host these? potentially one big sprite to save on requests)

    email: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2102433/send-email-via-gmail

download button (doesn't work with YT download link but does work with local file)

only play automatically when the user has wifi: https://coyotess.medium.com/how-to-get-information-about-user-network-connection-in-javascript-4d63fd58f15f


AESTHETIC:
add spinner when loading time skip

clean up controls on mobile (maybe with a settings button toggle)
    move timeline to the bottom of video and enable scrubbing at all times
    thinner version of fullscreen button
    keep brightness slider in view? it's nice
    somehow "comments will be added later" is split into two lines on mobile
    maaaaybe don't have as much controls delay in the middle as on the sides (like on YouTube)

put svgs from player into sprite.svg

add a "more" button to the description

privacy policy is a bit narrow on mobile, and email address has no underlining

make brightness and volume sliders go up instead of sideways

autofill makes the searchbar light

custom right-click menu

miniplayer title, if too long, should scroll automatically

for the channel and video count, start at 0 and then animate to the actual number


SEO:
make a tags that don't lead to another page button tags

improve load speed

    https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsleebi.net%2F&tab=mobile
    https://web.dev/articles/optimize-cls
    defer loading of lower priority JS/CSS
        like when doing ssr, only load the appropriate JS/CSS at initial load, and then load the rest async
        optimize loading of sleebi player VS YT player (perhaps pre-loading when on home page)
    compress JS/CSS
    browser caching

    load subset of videos for initial load, and then load the rest async
    have separate HTML for home/search, watch Sleebi, watch embed because they have different needs
        then use the same SPA for the rest
        different min.js and min.css for each page with the rest async loaded
        if necessary could even generate the Sleebi and embed HTML from what we have now with a script so that it's always up to date
