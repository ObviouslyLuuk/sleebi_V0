FIXES:
thumbnail before starting video is not stretched anymore but now doesn't cover

Mac issues:
    volume icon not showing
    low brightness icon not showing (this seems to have to do with the svg element)
    those two sliders always taking up space even when not showing (this isn't a problem with display none/block, but is with using width)
    fullscreen button not working (on Safari and Firefox it's simply a different function. On iOS there's no function, but you can switch to their native player)
iPhone:
    make two separate buttons for fullscreen:
        one for iOS fullscreen
        one for webapp fullscreen (which is just a div that takes up the whole screen)

ADDITIONS:
remove bootstrap and replace with custom css
add email list signup

make loading spinner for video player

add channel screen

triggers as tags

filter based on triggers
filter based on duration
sort search results by date, views, like-ratio, etc

have video preview GIFs when hovering over a video. Scrape from YT in the mouseover-overlay:

or if not available, just a playbutton icon

add previews to the video player scrubber (where to host these? potentially one big sprite to save on requests)

add a "more" button to the description

replace tipjar link with ko-fi widget and in-page panel

put svgs from player into sprite.svg
