        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Last updated: Dec 2, 2023</p>

        <p>Thank you for using Sleebi! Your privacy matters to me, and I want to be clear about how I handle any data.
            This Privacy Policy explains how Sleebi currently handles your privacy.</p>

        <h2>1. No Personal Information Collected:</h2>

        <p>1.1 <strong>No Personal Data:</strong> I don't collect any personal information that could identify you. No data is collected from or
            merged with other sources (like using Google Analytics to track your browsing habits). I'm committed to keeping
            your privacy a priority.</p>

        <h2>2. Video watching</h2>

        <p>2.1 <strong>Sleebi-hosted videos:</strong> When I add user authentication, your account will keep track of your watch history for personalized recommendations.</p>

        <p>2.2 <strong>Embedded YouTube Videos:</strong> If I embed any videos from YouTube (this means you'd see the YouTube player instead of the Sleebi player, 
            so without the brightness and blue-light filter) 
            I will use the nocookie host for improved privacy. Check YouTube's privacy policy for their data practices and what cookies they use.</p>

        <h2>3. Ko-fi Pop-up:</h2>

        <p>3.1 <strong>Donation Pop-up:</strong> I use a Ko-fi pop-up window for donations. 
            Any cookies that ko-fi adds during this are temporary and are removed when you close the window.</p>

        <h2>4. Piwik Analytics:</h2>

        <p>4.1 <strong>Analytics Data:</strong> I use Piwik analytics to understand how users interact with Sleebi. This
            includes which pages are visited and how often, but not by whom.</p>

        <p>4.2 <strong>IP Masking:</strong> I mask out IP addresses before storing any data to ensure your anonymity.</p>

        <p>4.3 <strong>Geographical Information:</strong> I only collect country-level information for page views. This
            helps optimize server locations for better load times but doesn't identify your regional or city-level
            location.</p>
        
        <p>4.4 <strong>Session Logs:</strong> Session log reports are hidden, following CNIL guidelines.
            This prevents any information about user sessions being visible to me before consent is given.
        </p>

        <p>The following only applies if you've accepted cookies:</p>

        <p>4.5 <strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic information about devices is collected to optimize the user experience.
            This includes device type, operating system, and browser type. Again this is anonymous and doesn't identify
            your specific device.
        </p>

        <p>4.6 <strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> Piwik analytics uses cookies for visitor identification (_pk_id and _pk_ses
            cookies) and session hashes. These do not involve profiling or cross-site identification. This means I can
            see how many unique visitors there are, but not who they are.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Consent and Data Retention:</h2>

        <p>5.1 <strong>Consent:</strong> Your consent will be asked again after 12 months to ensure you're still happy with
            the current Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <p>5.2 <strong>Data Retention:</strong> Piwik stores any collected data for 14 months. After that, it's deleted.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Choices:</h2>

        <p>6.1 
            <strong>Privacy / Cookie Settings:</strong> 
            <!-- Sleebi doesn't collect any data unless you've agreed to receive cookies.

            <p>
                A cookie is a small text file that a website saves in your browser. Cookies are generally used to store information about your visit and preferences,
                like whether you want cookies.

                        Sleebi doesn't collect any data unless you've agreed to receive cookies. 
                        You can change your cookie preferences at any time. In the future, if cookie-dependent features are added,

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Your consent decision will be stored in a cookie called "ppms_privacy" for 12 months; this counts as a "strictly necessary" cookie. 
                If you clear your cookies, you'll be asked again.
            </p>


        <h2>7. Data Security:</h2>

        <p>7.1 <strong>Security Measures:</strong> I use industry-standard measures to protect all collected data mentioned above. Keep in mind that no
            method is 100% secure.</p>

        <p>7.2 <strong>Third-Party Links:</strong> Sleebi may contain links to third-party websites. I'm not responsible for
            their privacy practices. I recommend you read their privacy policies.</p>

        <p>7.3 <strong>Data Selling:</strong> I will never sell any collected data to third parties.
        </p>

            Privacy Policy. Look at the date at the top for the latest update. I recommend you check back every so often to
            stay informed.
