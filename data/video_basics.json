recorded (some classic random ASMR) so I'll probably upload that next weekend!\n\nAlso for anyone interested I thought of a couple things I didn't say but thought of afterwards;\nIf I don't get into the master's degree (which is the most likely scenario, but that won't stop me trying) I'm fine with that and will just try again the year after with much more time to prepare.\nAlso watching it back I feel like some people might think I'm like hyping up my coding skills but I'm really not that good I just really like it :')\nAnd third, and this doesn't necessarily apply to me but more a mindset: I call coding my calling/passion etc and I feel like some people are in search of that one thing to do for the rest of their lives, but personally, feeling like I've found it, I don't think things like these are necessarily a passion for life. It very well could be but don't get too hung up trying to find something like that and don't worry when something you once thought was your passion doesn't interest you as much anymore, just keep trying new things and do what you enjoy most, you'll be okay :)\n\nGo ahead and stalk me:\nInstagram: ObviouslyASMR\nTwitter: ObviouslyLuuk\n\na little tipjar:\nPayPal: ObviouslyASMR@gmail.com\n\nA BIG thanks to my lovely Patrons for supporting me and helping me keep making videos :)\nAlanna\nAlissa\nAna\nAnder\nAndie\nAnn-Sophie\nAtria\nChangyu\nChristina\nChristopher\nDawna\nFadi\nHayley\nilluuminati\nIris\nJacob\nJoey\nKeely\nKevin\nLauren\nLulu\nLydia\nMarkus\nMarshall\nMatthew\nMolly\nMiranda\nNick\nPatrick\nRenata\nRia\nRicky\nRobert\nSeungwoo\nShuo\nStan\nTaeWoo\nThe Lonely Wizard\nTim\nWillow\nXenia\nYannis\nYasser\n\n\n\n\nOh btw if you were wondering, ASMR (or \u0430\u0441\u043c\u0440 in Russian :P) is a tingly feeling people get from sounds and visual stimuli (for example whispering, tapping or hand movements), these tingles are very relaxing :) however, even for those who don't experience ASMR the videos often still help them sleep and battle insomnia\n\n\nBye :)", "tags": ["asmr", "[asmr]", "\u0430\u0441\u043c\u0440", "tingles", "male asmr", "obviouslyasmr", "obviously", "soothing", "sounds", "triggers", "whisper", "whispers", "whispering", "asmr whispering", "ear to ear", "binaural", "relax", "relaxing", "relaxation", "sleep", "insomnia", "stress relief", "stress", "asmr sleep", "calm down", "calming", "asmr calming", "relaxing video", "asmr video", "whispered ramble", "life update", "luuk"], "duration": 2231, "published": "2021-01-31T12:00:06-08:00", "uploaded": "2021-01-31T12:00:06-08:00", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hKTpxeQ5VgQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "views": 105198, "channel_id": "UChXogayC52mlROq-N71_f5g", "channel_name": "Obviously ASMR", "channel_@name": "@ObviouslyASMR", "channel_icon_url": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/G0in2VstE1qVGi8-NRHXHCGxWs4wjEJA55vXPBdVmpNzeV2hBn9j2uwgj19UB8zz8Wmvtmp50w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"}, "ZPUYmlL3KzY": {"id": "ZPUYmlL3KzY", "title": "Cleaning Energy Around the Mic ASMR (incl inaudible whispers)", "description": "Hey hi!
